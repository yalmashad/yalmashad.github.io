      <h3>Available</h3>
       <p>One of BIG-IP core functions is load balancing, which entails managing network traffic such that no one server becomes overwhelmed while others idle. This improves application performance and availability.</p>

	<h3>Fast</h3>       
       <p>BIG IP is able to shift key tasks away from the server to its own processor in order to improve performance. This can reduce the number of servers in a typical datacenter by as much as 60% and speed up the performance of the remaining servers.</p>

       	    <h3>Secure</h3>
       <p>BIG-IP identifies and stops most DDoS attacks before they reach the datacenter. With hardware-based DoS protections, BIG-IP detects DDoS attacks and routes the connections away from critical servers, or rejects them outright.</p>
